# Python-Scripting-Project

Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a Python script that automates the process of pinging multiple hosts from a predefined list. The script aims to simplify network troubleshooting and availability checks by reporting the reachability status of each host in an efficient and readable format.

Skills Learned
- Python Scripting Fundamentals: Strengthened knowledge of Python syntax, control structures, and best practices.
- Network Automation: Gained hands-on experience in automating network tasks using Python.
- Error Handling: Implemented exception handling to manage unreachable hosts or invalid inputs gracefully.
- File I/O: Read hostnames or IP addresses from external text files and wrote output results to a file or console.
- Script Optimization: Improved script performance and readability by using loops, functions, and conditional logic.

Tools Used
I have used PyCharm version 2023.3.4, It is intuitive to utilise and write the script on this IDE, it was easy to debug issue with the script whilst working on it.
